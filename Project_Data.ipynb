    "They cover a wide range of properties including homes, commercial buildings, and rental units.\n",

    "However, with the current method, they can't accurately estimating property damage costs, which directly impact premium pricing for policyholders and result in dissatisfied policyholders and financial losses for the company.\n",

    "# Data Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizing the `faker` and `pandas`libraries, a dataset can be generated to include the following relationship between variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Property Type and Claim Type Relationship**: Different property types (Single-Family Home, Apartment, Commercial Building) have varying probabilities of experiencing specific claim types (Fire, Water Damage, Theft). This relationship reflects the differing risks associated with each property type.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Property Age and Property Damage Cost Relationship**: Older properties (higher property age) may have higher property damage costs due to wear and tear. This is reflected in the age-specific damage multipliers, where older properties are more likely to incur higher costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Construction Material and Property Damage Cost Relationship**: The choice of construction material (Wood, Concrete, Steel) affects the property damage cost. Steel has a higher damage multiplier, meaning properties made of steel are more costly to repair or replace.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Property Size and Crime Rate Relationship**: Property size influences the crime rate. Larger properties have a higher likelihood of experiencing a higher crime rate, introducing a correlation between property size and the risk of property-related incidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Weather Conditions and Claim Type Relationship**: Weather conditions (precipitation and temperature) impact the likelihood of specific claim types. For example, higher precipitation may lead to more Water Damage claims, and colder regions may have more claims related to Fire incidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Property Size and Insured Value Relationship**: Property size directly affects the insured value. Larger properties have a higher insured value, reflecting the higher cost to insure a larger property.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Outliers and Missing Values**: Introducing outliers in insured value and missing values in property type and claim type creates noise and missing data, mimicking the variability and data quality issues often encountered in real-world datasets."
