# Project - Predicting Property Damage Costs

The Property Damage Cost Prediction project is focused on revolutionizing insurance pricing accuracy. Through advanced regression techniques and a comprehensive dataset, this project aims to develop a predictive model that ensures fair and precise property damage cost estimates for ProGuard Insurance. By adhering to a stringent performance criterion, we'll unveil the critical factors impacting damage costs, leading to enhanced premium pricing and overall customer satisfaction.

## Project Overview

This project aims to revolutionize the accuracy of property damage cost estimation for a leading property insurance company by generating a realistic dataset using Python libraries such as `Faker` and `Pandas`. With features such as property type, age, crime rate, construction materials, weather conditions, claim history, insured value, policyholder age, and property size, we have a rich set of attributes to work with.

Our primary goal is to develop a regression model that accurately predicts property damage costs. However, we've set a stringent performance criterion - the average percentage difference between predicted and actual values must be less than 20%. This ensures that the model's predictions align closely with real-world property damage costs, providing the foundation for fair and reliable premium pricing.

The project will culminate in a comprehensive data generation and a report documenting the systematic approach.
